# Population Growth Calculator

This simple Java program calculates the population growth of organisms over a specified number of days based on user input. The user is prompted to enter the initial number of organisms, the average daily percentage increase, and the number of days the organisms will be growing. The program then displays the population for each day.

## Getting Started

To run this program, you need to have Java installed on your machine.

1. **Clone this repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IbyG/Java_Organism_Population.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
```cd population-growth-calculator```

3. **Compile the Java file:**
```javac Population.java```

4. ***Run the compiled program:***
```java Population```

# Usage
1. Enter the starting number of organisms (must be greater than 2).
2. Enter the average daily percentage increase (in decimal form).
3. Enter the number of days the organisms will be growing.

The program will then display the population for each day.

# Example
```
What is the starting Number of Organisms (>2): 5
What is the average daily percentage increase: 0.05
How many days will the organisms be growing for: 3

On Day 1 the population increased to 5.26
On Day 2 the population increased to 5.52
On Day 3 the population increased to 5.79
```
